**** Clean Code ****
by Robert C. Martin

- Pass max 3 arguments through a method/function exp: func(arg1, arg2, arg3), if need more, try to
merge it in a class
- Separate main code and error handling -> error handling in other function
- Create learning tests for API/3rd Party
- TDD laws:
   * First Law You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test.
   * Second Law You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling
   is failing.
   * Third Law You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the cur- rently
   failing test.
